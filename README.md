# Risc-V pipeline CPU with mini kernel

This is a pipelined CPU written in Verilog using the Risc-V instruction set, with early Linux kernel scheduling.

You can use verilator for simulation, check the Makefile for usage.

**This project has only been tested and run on FPGA specific development boards.**
